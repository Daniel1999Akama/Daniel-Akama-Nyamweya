# Exploring the Role of Informatics in Managing Emerging Infectious Diseases

## Overview
This research project investigates the critical role of health informatics in addressing the challenges posed by emerging infectious diseases. It highlights how digital platforms and tools such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) contribute to disease surveillance, monitoring, and preparedness, while also identifying areas where these systems can be improved.

## Research Question
How does health informatics support professionals in the surveillance, documentation, preparedness, and response to emerging infectious diseases, and what are its current limitations?

## Methodology
- **Literature Review**: Examined academic and professional sources on informatics systems used in disease management.
- **Case Studies**: Analyzed past examples of informatics application during disease outbreaks (e.g., COVID-19, Ebola).
- **Gap Identification**: Assessed current shortcomings in interoperability, usability, and real-time response capacity.
- **Tools Studied**: EHR platforms, GIS tools, and integrated digital surveillance systems.

## Key Findings
- Informatics systems greatly enhance data collection and coordination among healthcare professionals.
- EHR interoperability remains a major barrier across institutions and agencies.
- GIS is powerful for spatial analysis but poses a steep learning curve for new users.
- Timely and accurate data sharing is crucial for effective response and preparedness.

## Personal Contribution
- Conducted the literature review and data synthesis.
